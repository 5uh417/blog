Summary: Essential Vim tips and tricks that transformed my coding efficiency and why mastering modal editing is worth the learning curve.

After years of using modern IDEs, switching to Vim felt like learning to code all over again. But the productivity gains were worth every keystroke.

## Essential Movement Commands

### Basic Navigation
- `h, j, k, l` - Left, down, up, right
- `w, b` - Word forward, word backward
- `0, $` - Beginning and end of line
- `gg, G` - Top and bottom of file

### Advanced Movement
- `f{char}` - Jump to next occurrence of character
- `/{pattern}` - Search and jump to pattern
- `%` - Jump to matching bracket
- `Ctrl+d, Ctrl+u` - Half page down/up

## Text Manipulation Magic

### Quick Edits
- `ciw` - Change inner word
- `di"` - Delete inside quotes
- `yap` - Yank around paragraph
- `>ip` - Indent paragraph

### Multiple Line Operations
- `V` - Visual line mode
- `:s/old/new/g` - Search and replace
- `Ctrl+v` - Visual block mode for column edits

## Powerful Combinations

The real power of Vim comes from combining commands:

```
d2w    # Delete next 2 words
c3j    # Change next 3 lines
y4k    # Yank previous 4 lines
>5>    # Indent next 5 lines
```

## Custom Configurations

My `.vimrc` essentials:
```vim
set number relativenumber
set tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4
set incsearch hlsearch
set autoindent smartindent
```

## Why Vim Matters in 2025

Even with modern IDEs, Vim skills transfer everywhere:
- SSH into servers without GUI
- Faster text editing in any context
- Universal availability across systems
- Muscle memory that lasts decades

The initial learning curve is steep, but the long-term productivity gains make it worthwhile for any serious developer.
