Summary: Practical Git workflows that scale from personal projects to small team collaboration, with real-world examples and best practices.

Choosing the right Git workflow can make the difference between smooth collaboration and merge conflicts nightmare. Here's what I've learned from various team sizes.

## Solo Developer Workflow

### Simple Feature Branch Flow
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
git add .
git commit -m "Add user login functionality"

# When ready to deploy
git checkout main
git merge feature/user-authentication
git branch -d feature/user-authentication
git push origin main
```

### Benefits for Solo Work
- Clean history with logical commits
- Easy rollback to stable states
- Practice for team collaboration
- Better organization of features

## Small Team Workflows

### GitHub Flow (Recommended for Most Teams)

1. **Create branch** from main
2. **Make commits** on feature branch
3. **Open pull request** for review
4. **Merge** after approval
5. **Deploy** from main branch

```bash
# Team member workflow
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/payment-integration

# Work and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Implement stripe payment processing"
git push origin feature/payment-integration

# Create PR through GitHub/GitLab UI
```

### Git Flow (For Release-Heavy Projects)

More complex but suitable for products with scheduled releases:

- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch
- **feature/***: New features
- **release/***: Release preparation
- **hotfix/***: Emergency fixes

## Commit Message Best Practices

### The Conventional Commits Format
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Examples
```bash
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support
fix(ui): resolve button alignment on mobile
docs(api): update authentication endpoint examples
refactor(db): optimize user query performance
test(auth): add unit tests for login validation
```

### Why Good Commit Messages Matter
- Easier code reviews
- Better git history navigation
- Automated changelog generation
- Faster debugging and rollbacks

## Branching Strategies

### Branch Naming Conventions
```bash
feature/user-profile-page
bugfix/login-redirect-issue
hotfix/security-vulnerability
release/v2.1.0
```

### Branch Lifecycle Management
```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-dashboard

# Regular sync with main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/new-dashboard
git rebase main

# Clean up after merge
git branch -d feature/new-dashboard
git push origin --delete feature/new-dashboard
```

## Code Review Process

### Pull Request Template
```markdown
## Description
Brief description of changes

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
- [ ] Documentation update

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] All tests passing

## Screenshots (if applicable)
```

### Review Guidelines
1. **Small, focused PRs** (< 400 lines when possible)
2. **Clear descriptions** of what and why
3. **Test coverage** for new functionality
4. **Documentation updates** when needed

## Handling Merge Conflicts

### Prevention Strategies
- Frequent pulls from main branch
- Small, focused commits
- Clear communication about overlapping work
- Regular rebasing of feature branches

### Resolution Process
```bash
# When conflict occurs during merge
git status  # See conflicted files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

### Using Visual Merge Tools
```bash
# Configure merge tool (one-time setup)
git config --global merge.tool vscode
git config --global mergetool.vscode.cmd 'code --wait $MERGED'

# Use during conflicts
git mergetool
```

## Advanced Git Techniques

### Interactive Rebase for Clean History
```bash
# Squash last 3 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# In the editor:
pick abc1234 Add user model
squash def5678 Fix typo in user model
squash ghi9012 Add user validation
```

### Cherry-picking for Hotfixes
```bash
# Apply specific commit to another branch
git checkout hotfix/critical-bug
git cherry-pick abc1234
```

### Stashing for Quick Context Switches
```bash
# Save current work
git stash push -m "WIP: implementing user preferences"

# Switch contexts
git checkout different-branch

# Return and restore work
git checkout original-branch
git stash pop
```

## Team Collaboration Tips

### Communication
- **Link issues to PRs** for context
- **Tag reviewers** appropriately
- **Update PR descriptions** when scope changes
- **Use draft PRs** for early feedback

### Continuous Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Check code style
        run: npm run lint
```

### Repository Maintenance
- Regular cleanup of merged branches
- Archive old releases and tags
- Update .gitignore for new file types
- Review and update team guidelines

## Tools and Integrations

### Git Aliases for Efficiency
```bash
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.st status
git config --global alias.unstage 'reset HEAD --'
git config --global alias.last 'log -1 HEAD'
git config --global alias.visual '!gitk'
```

### GUI Tools Worth Considering
- **GitKraken**: Visual git client with timeline
- **Sourcetree**: Free tool from Atlassian
- **VSCode**: Built-in git integration
- **GitHub Desktop**: Simple GitHub-focused client

The key to successful Git workflows is starting simple and evolving based on team needs. Don't over-engineer the process â€“ the best workflow is the one your team actually follows consistently.
