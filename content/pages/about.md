# About Me

Welcome to my digital corner of the web. I'm **Suhail**, a Staff Software Engineer and DevOps Specialist who lives at the intersection of clean code, scalable systems, and operational excellence.

## What I Do

I'm passionate about:

- **Python-first development** — writing clean, testable, and production-ready code  
- **DevOps and Infrastructure** — automating Puppet-based ecosystems at scale  
- **CI/CD optimization** — reducing deployment time and improving delivery confidence  
- **Observability and incident hygiene** — not just reducing noise, but fixing real root causes  
- **Data-driven engineering** — building dashboards and tools with BigQuery, PostgreSQL, and Grafana  

## My Philosophy

> "Code should serve its environment as gracefully as a well-oiled tool. Fast. Clear. Uncomplicated."

I believe in building systems that work *with* the engineer, not against them — whether it's a terminal workflow, an automation pipeline, or a deployment strategy.

## Current Focus

Right now I'm diving deep into:

- **Agentic AI and Google ADK** — integrating LLM agents with infrastructure tools like Puppet  
- **Microservices architecture** — designing systems for scale, observability, and resilience  
- **Impact analysis tooling** — mapping how code changes propagate across node groups  
- **Multi-PuppetDB orchestration** — tracking deployment success across distributed environments  

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:

- Dialing in my espresso and experimenting with brewing techniques  
- Reading about distributed systems and design patterns  
- Hitting the gym 5 days a week with a structured strength training split  
- Exploring minimalist productivity systems that actually reduce friction  
- Sharing fixes, war stories, and open source contributions  

## Get In Touch

I love connecting with engineers, builders, and curious minds. Feel free to reach out if you want to talk code, systems design, AI agents, or just trade notes on the best coffee brewing gear.
